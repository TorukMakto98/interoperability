# Assignment 2 - Documentation
### Mattes Barkowski - Interoperability

This readme provides some general information on the setup of my database dump. To import my database in your local
postgre database you can simply import it over pgAdmin or some other postgre cli tool. If you need my environmental 
variables to login, here are they:

- USER: postgres
- PASSWORD: postgres
- DBNAME: postgres
- DB_HOST: localhost

If you like to setup the database over the code, please create first a new database locally on your server, change the 
environmental variables in the code (line 16-20) and start the main class. The script will create all necessary tables
and generate the data.

You can access the code over Github under the following link
